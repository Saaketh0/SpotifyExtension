These are the files to the Chrome Extension I coded that displays the current Spotify Song playing from your Spotify on the top left portion of your browser.
Currently working on getting it on the Chrome Web Store. Will be working on this when freed up, debugging and making the design nicer.

This extension will be requesting permission from your Spotify account, and will only be pulling current song data, pulling the current song Artist's Name, Album Name, and Album Cover.
